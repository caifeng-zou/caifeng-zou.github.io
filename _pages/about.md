I am a Ph.D. student at [Caltech Seismo Lab](https://www.seismolab.caltech.edu/), advised by [Zachary E. Ross](https://ross.caltech.edu/) and [Robert W. Clayton](https://web.gps.caltech.edu/~clay/). I obtained my M.Sc. in Applied Computational Science and Engineering from Imperial College London and B.Sc. in Geophysics from Tongji University. 

My research interests include seismic wave propagation, full waveform inversion, uncertainty quantification, seismic interferometry, and AI for seismology. I work with seismic data collected from urban areas and use auto- and cross-correlation to image sedimentary basins. I develop machine learning methods that are orders of magnitude faster than conventional approaches to invert for subsurface velocity structures in the greater Los Angeles region. I also develop ML methods for structural health monitoring of buildings.

Outside of research, I love badminton, music, and my dog, Bella.
